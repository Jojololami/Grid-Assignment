                    code. I needed <br> some structure from professionals <br> who can help me learn
                    programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enrol by a former student
                    of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum
                    and staff did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long
                    for <br> assistance. The agile team project in <br> particular was outstanding. It took <br> 
                    my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no totorial could ever have. In <br>
                    fact, I've often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> development
                    experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after
                    receiving multiple <br> offers. 100% recommend!'
