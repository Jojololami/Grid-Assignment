                    shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my

                    code. I needed some structure from <br> professionals who can help me learn
                    programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to enrol by a <br> former student
                    of theirs who can only say <br> wonderful things about the program. The entire <br> curriculum
                    and staff did not disappoint. They were <br> very hands-on and I never had to wait long
                    for <br> assistance. The agile team project in particular <br> was outstanding. It took 
                    my learning to the next <br> level in a way that no totorial could ever have. In <br>
                    fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an <br> example of my development
                    experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after <br>
                    receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!'
